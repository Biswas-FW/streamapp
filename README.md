# Data Processing and Translation App

This project is a Streamlit application that processes user-provided titles from a CSV format, analyzes the text to identify the top 1000 most frequent words, and translates them into English using the Google Translator API.

## Features

- Processes text input to count word frequencies, excluding common stopwords and punctuation.
- Translates the most common words into English.
- Displays the results in a tabular format and provides an option to download the processed data as a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `nltk`
- `pandas`
- `streamlit`
- `deep_translator`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas streamlit deep-translator
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download Required NLTK Resources:**
   The application uses NLTK resources for tokenization and stopwords. You need to download these resources before running the app:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('punkt_tab')
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   After ensuring that the required libraries and NLTK resources are set up, you can run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run your_script_name.py
   ```

3. **Input Titles:**
   - Paste your titles in CSV format into the text area provided in the app.
   - Click on the process button to analyze the data.

4. **View Translations:**
   The application will display a table with the top 1000 words, their translations, and their frequency of occurrence.

5. **Download Processed Data:**
   You can download the processed data as a CSV file using the download button provided in the app interface.

## Code Explanation

The main functionalities of the app are defined in the `process_titles` function:

- **Tokenization:** Titles are tokenized into words using NLTK's `word_tokenize` function.
- **Frequency Counting:** The frequency of each word is counted using Python's `collections.Counter`.
- **Translation:** The most frequent words are translated into English using the `deep_translator` library.
  
An example of the relevant code block is:
```python
def process_titles(titles):
    ...
```
